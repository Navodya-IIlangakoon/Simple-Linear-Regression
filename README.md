# 🏠 Simple Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview

This project involves performing a **simple linear regression analysis** to predict house prices. The goal was to implement, interpret, and evaluate a linear model using Python's scikit-learn library.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare the dataset (including adding missing column names).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Fit a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- Interpret regression coefficients.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
  - R-squared
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – for data handling
- **scikit-learn** – for regression modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for implementation and analysis
